// The second hop: routing the tunnel's output through a node of your own.
//
// Cloudflare WARP is explicit that it does not change your country -- it
// egresses near you and geolocates the exit address to your region. So a user
// in Iran connects successfully and still looks like they are in Iran. The
// only way to change that is to add a hop after the tunnel.
//
// mihomo does the hop. Its `dialer-proxy` dials a node *through* another
// proxy, so every node is reached from inside the MASQUE tunnel and the exit
// address becomes the node's, not Cloudflare's. Verified end to end before any
// of this was written: a real subscription moved the visible country from TH
// to JP, and the tunnel saw the node being dialled through it.
//
// Two consequences of that order are worth stating, because they are the whole
// reason it is this way round and not the other:
//
// - the node is dialled from inside the tunnel, so local filtering sees an
//   ordinary Cloudflare connection and never the node's address or SNI, and
// - a node blocked from this network is still reachable, because it is reached
//   from Cloudflare's network rather than from here.
