// Tor as a carrier: three relays, and a SOCKS5 listener at the end of them.
//
// The same shape as [`crate::psiphon`] — a supervised child that ends in a
// listener mihomo routes into — and a different protocol for finding out what
// it is doing. Tor speaks a line-based control protocol on a loopback port
// rather than emitting notices, so this authenticates to that port and asks.
//
// ## Connected means bootstrapped, not listening
//
// The one thing that must not be got wrong here. Tor binds its SOCKS port and
// opens its control port almost immediately, long before it has a circuit —
// and a SOCKS listener with no circuit behind it accepts connections and then
// sits on them. Reporting connected there ships a carrier that says it is
// working and carries nothing, which on the Android client is exactly how meek
// passed review and then failed for three minutes straight.
//
// So the gate is `GETINFO status/bootstrap-phase` reporting `PROGRESS=100`,
// and nothing else counts.
//
// ## No datagrams, and that is declared rather than discovered
//
// Tor carries TCP only. [`CarrierKind::Tor`] says so, which puts `udp: false`
// on the proxy mihomo dials and a `NETWORK,udp,REJECT` rule above the default
// route. Both halves matter: a proxy that claims UDP and swallows it is
// experienced as DNS and QUIC hanging while TCP works, which is the hardest
// shape of broken to recognise. Refused, a resolver retries over TCP and a
// browser drops off QUIC, both within a round trip. The chain's own resolvers
// are DNS-over-HTTPS, so names still resolve throughout.
