// the moment of connecting, so it cannot answer the question the status screen
// actually asks: is the route still good *now*.
//
// So we measure it ourselves. A SOCKS5 CONNECT through the local listener out
// to a fixed address times the whole path — client, engine, MASQUE tunnel,
// edge, and the TCP handshake at the far end. It is the same work a browser
// does to open a connection, which is what makes it worth showing.
